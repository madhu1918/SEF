			"text": "<b>Purpose of the Activity</b><br>Taking effective notes is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Most students have developed short-term memory skills that support preparation for final exams, but seldom produce long-term memories . Writing out notes in your own words (not copying the words of others) and explaining why the items are important and/or meaningful tends to build long lasting memories and connection.<br>"
