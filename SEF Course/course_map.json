        "The goal of this course is to lay solid Software Engineering Foundation for graduate students moving into their final year of studies in the MSIT program. Programming skills are crucial, but producing workable code without industry standards is not sufficient. Professionals in industry produce workable software products that seamlessly maps design into code. A successful software professional must have many skills as well as a wealth of experience in order to predictably deliver quality products on time and within budget."
